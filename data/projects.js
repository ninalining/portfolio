    shortDescription: "A terminal-based typing practice program.",
    details: "This project is a Python-based terminal program designed to help users practice typing. It features multiple difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) and calculates typing accuracy based on words and characters. The program includes a menu system for selecting difficulty, reading text files, and saving results to a score file. Key features include:\n\n- **Word and Character Precision**: Calculates accuracy by comparing user input with the original text, handling cases where input length differs from the original.\n- **Error Tracking**: Tracks and displays the most frequently mistyped characters.\n- **Score Management**: Saves user scores with names and difficulty levels in a sorted file.\n- **Optimized File Handling**: Uses functions to efficiently open, read, and close files, avoiding redundancy.\n\nThis project was a challenging yet rewarding experience, enhancing skills in Python, file handling, and data processing. It emphasized writing clean, reusable code and solving real-world problems like handling varying input lengths and tracking errors.",

    shortDescription: "A JavaScript-based tool for conducting interactive intelligence tests.",
    details: "This project is a web-based intelligence test tool built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It consists of three main tests:\n\n- **TipsTest**: A quiz with multiple-choice questions loaded dynamically from a JSON file. Users receive immediate feedback and score points for correct answers.\n- **FizzBuzzTest**: A logic-based test where users guess the next value in a FizzBuzz sequence. The sequence starts with a random value to ensure variety.\n- **MemoryTest**: A challenging memory game where users recall the positions of images displayed briefly. This test required custom event handling and dynamic DOM manipulation.\n\nKey features include:\n\n- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Questions and images are loaded dynamically from JSON files.\n- **Reusable Code**: Shared functions for handling questions and user interactions were organized into a common module.\n- **Event Handling**: Custom logic for managing user clicks and validating answers.\n\nThis project was a significant learning experience, emphasizing modular code structure, event handling, and dynamic content management. While challenging, it provided valuable insights into JavaScript development and problem-solving.",

    shortDescription: "A responsive and accessible portfolio website for a freelance web developer.",
    details: "This project involved creating a professional portfolio website for Linnéa Leewong, a freelance web developer and designer. The website was built using Pico CMS and includes the following features:\n\n- **Three Pages**: A homepage with a hero image, an 'About Me' page describing the client's profile and services, and a project highlight page showcasing six previous projects.\n- **Custom Theme**: Designed with SASS, the theme uses a complementary color scheme with beige (#d9ceba) and blue-gray (#bac5d9) to reflect professionalism and creativity. Typography includes Poppins for headings and Roboto for body text.\n- **Responsive Design**: Implemented with CSS Grid and Flexbox, ensuring the site works seamlessly on mobile devices without horizontal scrollbars. Images are optimized using `<picture>` and `srcset` for different screen sizes.\n- **Accessibility**: Achieved a perfect Lighthouse accessibility score by adding alt texts for images, ensuring sufficient contrast, and testing with colorblind filters.\n- **Dark Theme Option**: An alternative dark theme with dark backgrounds (#181a1b) and light text (#dcddde) was created, allowing users to switch themes for a modern and elegant experience.\n\nThis project was both challenging and rewarding, involving tasks like managing image rights, resolving 403 errors, and balancing design with functionality. The final result is a visually appealing, responsive, and accessible website that effectively showcases the client's skills and services.",
